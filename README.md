The repository contains a series of assignments for Fall 2019 CSE101: Algorithms and Abstract Data Types taught by Patrick Tantalo from UCSC. 

From https://courses.engineering.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps101/, the class "Studies basic algorithms and their relationships to common abstract data types. Covers the notions of abstract data types and the distinction between an abstract data type and an implementation of that data type. The complexity analysis of common algorithms using asymptotic (big "O") notation is emphasized. Topics include sorting and searching techniques, basic graph algorithms, and algorithm design techniques. Abstract data types covered include priority queues, dictionaries, disjoint sets, heaps, balanced trees, and hashing."
